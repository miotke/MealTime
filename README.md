# Meal Time

A simple Django REST API that will serve a lunch menu for the week. This API will be accessed by
an iOS app(SwiftUI?) that I will build as well.

This project is for learning purposes.


Live API available here: https://afternoon-stream-26309.herokuapp.com and deployed to Heroku.


### Usage
* Create a Python virtual environment.
