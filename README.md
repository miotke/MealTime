# Meal Time

This repo is strictly for learning purposes.

A simple Django REST API that will serve a lunch menu for the week. This API is accessed by the iOS app that is included in this repo.

Live API available here: https://afternoon-stream-26309.herokuapp.com and deployed on Heroku. Please note this api is running on the free Heroku tier therefore the app may appear to take longer to startup for the first time. Heroku spins down the node that this api lives on when not in use. Subsequent app launches are much faster.


### Usage
* Open the XCode project and build, the app should connect to the live API.
